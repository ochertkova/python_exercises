# python_exercises

This repo contains a selection of exersises from different Python courses I completed in 2021-2022.
Some of them are meant for Jupyter notebook and some are for Linux virtual machine and therefore might not be easily executable.

**newspaper_face_detection.py** - searches for a given word in zip-archived newspaper pages and produces an image file with detected faces from those pages

**img_proc_channels.py**- processes a picture and creates a new one containing 9 variants with different RGB filters

**email_domain_change.py** - changes domain for a list of emails in a file

**log_file_analysis.py** - processes "system log" file and generates reports "errors by user" and "most frequent errors"
